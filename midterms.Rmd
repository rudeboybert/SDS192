# Midterm I {#midtermI}

## Administrative notes

* **Friday 10/4 5pm through Sunday 10/6 11:55pm**. You must submit your midterm no later than Sunday at 11:55pm.
* Instructions on taking exams for [Smithies](https://sophia.smith.edu/edtech/documentation/print-an-exam-from-the-direct-to-queue-application/){target="_blank"} and [Five College Students](https://sophia.smith.edu/edtech/documentation/special-instructions-for-five-college-and-high-school-students-using-direct-to-queue-exam-printing/){target="_blank"}. **Print the exam in color.**
* You will be given 140 mins to complete it (including transit time to writing area), however I try to time it so that it will take much less than that. In other words, you should have plenty of time to complete it without rushing.
* **Timestamps will be strictly enforced. Any timestamps indicating than more than 140 minutes are subject to a 50% penalty and an honor board case.**
* Closed-book, no internet, and individually completed.
* Bring colored pencils/pens


## Topics
    
* Topics: Lectures 1-10 inclusive (up to and including color theory in-class exercises).

    + ModernDive readings and learning checks.
