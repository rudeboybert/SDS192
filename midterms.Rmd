# Midterm I {#midtermI}

## Administrative notes

* **Friday 10/4 5pm through Sunday 10/6 11:55pm**. You must submit your midterm no later than Sunday at 11:55pm.
* Instructions on taking exams for [Smithies](https://sophia.smith.edu/edtech/documentation/print-an-exam-from-the-direct-to-queue-application/){target="_blank"} and [Five College Students](https://sophia.smith.edu/edtech/documentation/special-instructions-for-five-college-and-high-school-students-using-direct-to-queue-exam-printing/){target="_blank"}. **Print the exam in color.**

* Notes for before exam:
    + Link to print exam in the Seelye basement lab is posted on Moodle.
    + Bring colored pencils/pens.
    + You do not need a calculator.
    + Print exam in color.
* Notes for during exam:
    + Closed-book, no internet, and individually completed.
    + You will be given 140 mins to complete it (including transit time to writing area), however I try to time it so that it will take much less than that. In other words, you should have plenty of time to complete it without rushing.
    + **Timestamps will be strictly enforced. Any timestamps indicating than more than 140 minutes are subject to a 50% penalty and an honor board case.**
    + In case of potential errors or ambiguity on the exam, please note them, state your assumptions, and use your best judgement.
* Notes for after exam:
    + Be sure to timestamp your exam before returning. 
    + Insert exam in appropriately labeled box in hallway.



## Topics
    
* Topics: Lectures 1-10 inclusive (up to and including color theory in-class exercises).
* What to study:
    + Practice midterm posted on Slack. We'll go over them in Wednesday's lecture.
    + Lecture notes: both "chalk talk" and what's on webpage. 
    + Problem sets and solutions.
    + ModernDive readings and learning checks.
    
    
    
## Results

Boxplot of scores (out of 34) with no whiskers below. Quartiles were 30.12 / 32 / 33.

## Visualizations from midterm

Question 2.b):

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
example <- tibble(
  type = c("D", "B", "A", "C"), 
  fruit = c("apple", "apple", "orange", "orange"),
  city = c("Toronto", "Montreal", "Toronto", "Montreal"),
  number = c(3, 4, 2, 1)
)

ggplot(data = example, mapping = aes(x = type, y = number)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Type", y = "Number")
```

Question 2.c):

```{r}
ggplot(data = example, mapping = aes(x = fruit)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Fruit", y = "Number")
```

Question 2.d):

```{r}
ggplot(data = example, mapping = aes(x = fruit, y = number, fill = city)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Fruit", y = "Number", fill = "City")
```

Question 3:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prices <- c(-11, 12, 15, 20, 20, 
            30, 30, 30, 30, 40, 
            40, 40, 40, 41, 51)
tibble(prices = prices) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = prices)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip(ylim = c(-15, 60)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "price") +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank()) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 50, by=10))
```

Question 4, modified to show difference in proportion

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(babynames)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)

babynames_subset <- babynames %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Riley", "Casey")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = prop) %>% 
  group_by(year, name) %>% 
  summarize(M = sum(M, na.rm=TRUE), F = sum(F, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(diff = F - M)

ggplot(babynames_subset, aes(x=year, y=diff))  +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~name) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Female Prop - Male Prop", title = "Comparison of Casey and Riley")
```

## Topics
    
* Topics: 
    + Lecture 10-12. Last few topics on Data viz: Color theory, trend lines.
    + Lecture 14-20. Data wrangling, "tidy" data, and importing data.
* Themes:
    + The midterm is not "cummulative" in the sense that the focus will be on Lectures 10-20, but you still need to know/understand topics from Midterm I because the materials build on top of each other. 
    + Know how to write *pseudocode* like in the Available Seat Miles exercise in Lecture 19 on Wed 10/23. Click [here](https://twitter.com/rudeboybert/status/964181298691629056){target="_blank"} for examples. Pseudocode is both:
        + Just general enough to apply to any programming language/statistical software: R, python, SPSS, STATA, SAS, etc.
        + Just specific enough that the instructions are unambigious
    + Know the difference between these five joins: `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `inner_join()`, `full_join()`, and `anti_join()`. Go over the examples in Lec19.
* What to study. Here is my suggested order:
    + Practice midterm posted on Slack under `#general_announcement`: this will give you a feel for the types of questions to expect.
    + Read chalk talk notes: they emphasize/summarize the most important ideas.
    + ModernDive Learning Check 3.20 on available seat miles (solutions in Appendix D): this is an all-encompassing problem that draws on nearly all the data wrangling verbs we've seen.
    + ModernDive readings and learning checks: In particular the more theoretical ideas of "tidy" data.
    + Problem sets 04 and 05
