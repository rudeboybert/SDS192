## Topics
    
* Topics: 
    + Lecture 10-12. Last few topics on Data viz: Color theory, trend lines. **Added on 11/6**: No Shiny apps.
    + Lecture 14-20. Data wrangling, "tidy" data, and importing data.
* Themes:
    + The midterm is not "cummulative" in the sense that the focus will be on Lectures 10-20, but you still need to know/understand topics from Midterm I because the materials build on top of each other. 
    + Know how to write *pseudocode* like in the Available Seat Miles exercise in Lecture 19 on Wed 10/23. Click [here](https://twitter.com/rudeboybert/status/964181298691629056){target="_blank"} for examples. Pseudocode is both:
        + Just general enough to apply to any programming language/statistical software: R, python, SPSS, STATA, SAS, etc.
        + Just specific enough that the instructions are unambigious
    + Know the difference between these five joins: `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `inner_join()`, `full_join()`, and `anti_join()`. Go over the code examples on the course webpage for [Lec19](index.html#Lec19).
* What to study. Here is my suggested order:
    + Practice midterm posted on Slack under `#general_announcement`: this will give you a feel for the types of questions to expect.
    + Read chalk talk notes: they emphasize/summarize the most important ideas.
    + ModernDive Learning Check 3.20 on available seat miles (solutions in Appendix D): this is an all-encompassing problem that draws on nearly all the data wrangling verbs we've seen.
    + ModernDive readings and learning checks: In particular the more theoretical ideas of "tidy" data.
    + Problem sets 04 and 05


    
## Practice midterm notes

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(nycflights13)
library(babynames)
```

### Question 1

```{r}
babynames
```


### Question 2

```{r}
nrow(weather)
```


### Question 4

Based on [Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/){target="_blank"}.

```{r}
# drinks is not "tidy"
drinks

drinks_tidy <- drinks %>%
  # Convert to "tidy"
  pivot_longer(cols = ends_with("servings"), names_to = "type", values_to = "servings") %>%
  # Do text manipulation: only characters 1 thru 10. this trims off "_servings"
  mutate(type = str_sub(type, start=1, end=-10)) %>%
  arrange(country, type)
drinks_tidy

ggplot(drinks_tidy, aes(x = type, y = servings)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Alcohol type", y = "Number of servings")
```


### Question 6

You are presented with data on the Titanic disaster of 1912 in a data frame `Titanic`, which cross-classifies survival vs death by class, sex, and age. Write down the *pseudocode* of the commands that will output a table comparing survival vs death counts for the following three scenarios:

* by sex
* by sex and class and age
* to answer the question if the "women and children"-first policy of the White Star Line Company (the company that ran the Titanic) held true or not.

Note: you don't need to calculate the output table, just write the pseudocode that would produce it where the more concise the pseudocode the better. Here is what the `Titanic` data looks like:\\

```{r}
data(Titanic)
# Convert to tibble i.e. data frame
Titanic <- Titanic %>% 
  as_tibble()

Titanic
```

#### Solutions

The key thing to note here is that the different combinations of `Class`, `Sex`, `Age`, and `Survived` are *pre-counted* in the `n` variable. Thus the `Titanic` data frame has only 32 rows. This is different than the `titanic` data frame from [PS05 Question 2](static/PS/PS05_solutions.html){target="_blank"} that has 2201 rows: one for each passenger.

So the data wrangling is a little different! Here we must `sum(n)` whereas in PS05 we used the `n()` summary function to count rows. 


**Part a)**: by sex
```{r}
Titanic %>% 
  group_by(Sex, Survived) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n))
```

**Part b)**: by sex, age, and class

Nothing to do! We already have `Survived` (`"No"` vs `"Yes"`) counts split by these categories!

**Part c)**: In retrospect this question is much harder than you can expect on the midterm. However if you're curious:

First we need to have `Survived` (`"No"` vs `"Yes"`) counts for each `Sex` and `Age` combinations:

```{r}
Titanic %>% 
  group_by(Sex, Age, Survived) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n))
```

Next we need to identify the "women and children"

```{r}
Titanic %>% 
  group_by(Sex, Age, Survived) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  # Identify "women and children". Shout out to Adriana B. for suggesting this step to me!
  mutate(w_or_c = Sex == "Female" | Age == "Child")
```

Next `group_by()` this new variable and get the sum of `n`

```{r}
Titanic %>% 
  group_by(Sex, Age, Survived) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  # Identify "women and children". Shout out to Adriana B. for suggesting this step to me!
  mutate(w_or_c = Sex == "Female" | Age == "Child") %>% 
  # Get counts for "women and children":
  group_by(w_or_c, Survived) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n))
```

Next compute the proportions. We haven't done this much in class, but if you look in [tips and tricks](tips_and_tricks.html#prop), you'll see this is one of the rare cases we use `group_by()`, but not followed by a `summarize()` but a `mutate()` instead:

```{r}
Titanic %>% 
  group_by(Sex, Age, Survived) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  # Identify "women and children". Shout out to Adriana B. for suggesting this step to me!
  mutate(w_or_c = Sex == "Female" | Age == "Child") %>% 
  # Get counts for "women and children":
  group_by(w_or_c, Survived) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  # Compute proportions:
  group_by(w_or_c) %>% 
  mutate(
    total = sum(n),
    prop = n/total
  )
```

Lastly, to make things easier to look at, let's only look at `Survived` equals `"Yes"`

```{r}
Titanic %>% 
  group_by(Sex, Age, Survived) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  # Identify "women and children". Shout out to Adriana B. for suggesting this step to me!
  mutate(w_or_c = Sex == "Female" | Age == "Child") %>% 
  # Get counts for "women and children":
  group_by(w_or_c, Survived) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  
  # Compute proportions:
  group_by(w_or_c) %>% 
  mutate(
    total = sum(n),
    prop = n/total
  ) %>% 
  # Only survived:
  filter(Survived == "Yes")
```

So yes, it seems "women and children first" did hold as seen by the 69.9% vs 20.3%.
