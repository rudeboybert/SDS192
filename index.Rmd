# Lec 37: Wed 12/11 {#Lec37}

## Announcements

* SDS Major Fatima Keita is interested in organizing a group for students of color within SDS. She has also put together a [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2YZ785Y){target="_blank"} to gather students of color's experiences within SDS courses and the program more generally. The idea is that these experiences would then be anonymously shared with the SDS faculty in hope that we can work to improve inclusivity within the program and curriculum.  
* Comment about ModernDive:
    + Always free, always available at [ModernDive.com](https://moderndive.com/)

## Today's Topics/Activities

<center>
![](static/images/SQL.jpg){ width=300px }
</center>
<br>

* **If you remember only one important fact from today's lecture, remember this**:
    + If you know the `dplyr` package for data wrangling, you can get started with the SQL relational database management language in a day.
    + **Why?** Because they are both based on the same theoretical underpinning: [Database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization){target="_blank"} (1970).  
    Thus you can [transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_learning){target="_blank"} your _previous_ learnings to learn these _new_ tools.
* **Similarly**:
    + If you know the `ggplot2` package for data visualization, you can get started with data visualization platforms like [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/){target="_blank"} and [plotly](https://plot.ly/){target="_blank"} in a day. 
    + **Why?** Because they are both based on the same theoretical underpinning: [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447){target="_blank"} (2005).  
    Thus you can [transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_learning){target="_blank"} your _previous_ learnings to learn these _new_ tools.

### 1. Chalk Talk

* What SQL is about.
* 3 ways to access SQL.
* Some key SQL language *syntax*: set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language.

### 2. In-class exercise

**Goal**: Perform 2-3 SQL queries to convince yourself that "if you know `dplyr`, you can get started with SQL in a day." You'll be using databases on the `scidb.smith.edu` database created by our very own Prof. Ben Baumer!

* Install and open [MySQLWorkbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/){target="_blank"}; this whole process takes about 10 minutes and necessitates creating an account with Oracle.
* Close the "Welcome to MySQL Workbench" message
* Click the plus sign next to "MySQL Connections" to add a connection to a SQL database.
* Setup a new connection" as shown in Slide 13/16 of this [slide deck](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/lectures/29-sql.html#16).
* Click the resulting "scidb" box and input the password shown on Slide 13. Click "Continue Anyway"
* Copy and paste the code below into the Query window
* Run the 10 individual code segments delineated by `/*SQL comments*/` one at a time by highlighting them and clicking the "lightning" button.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rudeboybert/35098400f4f36c36fc5d0e96cb40786d.js"></script>

If you want to learn more, check out SDS Prof. Ben Baumer's notes [here](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/schedule.html#lam_2:_database_querying){target="_blank"}.

# Lec 29: Fri 11/15 {#Lec29}

## Announcements

* Sit next to your MP3 partner
* Guest lecturer: Prof. Ben Baumer

### Mega Announcement

Recently, the Five Colleges (with Smith as the lead institution) received a three-year grant from the NSF (totaling $1.2 million) for workforce development in data science. Most of that money will go to students, who will work on real-world data science projects sponsored by local community-based organizations. The Jandon Center for Community Engagement will be integrated into the project to bind all parties together. 

We are looking for students to join the first cohort. Smith students can earn up to $2500 per semester, which is approximately 60% more than you would make in any other campus job. The minimum requirements for data science students are:

* Has taken at least one course in computer programming
* Has taken at least one course in statistics
* Has taken at least one additional course in data science, data analysis, etc.
* Is a sophomore or junior
* Ability to commit to 8-10 hours per week through the spring semester

Unfortunately, only US citizens or permanent residents are eligible for funding from the NSF. It is possible that international students could be funded through a different mechanism, but there are no such alternative funding sources in place at present. 

The application is [here](https://dsc-wav.github.io/www/students.html){target="_blank"}, please APPLY NOW!! Please contact Ben Baumer if you have more questions.

* Check out the Jill Ker Conway Innovation & Entrepreneurship Center's feature on [SDS student Rachel Laflamme](https://conway-connect.com/innovation-news/2019/10/31/datascienceatvaliantlabs){target="_blank"}. In particular the quotes from the final paragraph:

> Rachel indicated that being surrounded by "so many really intimidating Smithies" in classes, students who she believed were much smarter than she, caused her to question whether she should even pursue a career as a statistical and data scientist. Needless to say, those of us in attendance during her presentation - one delivered by a knowledgeable, talented and confident Smithie - were surprised by her revelation...
> 
> Asked about her most important take-away from the summer, Rachel thoughtfully replied:  
> **"I learned that you have to understand your value and that you have a right to be compensated for the value that you bring. It’s a bold thing to fight for what you know you’re worth."**

## Today's topics/activities

### 1. Chalk talk

Solutions to PS05 Q1.c). What happened to the average age above 60? The hint given on Slack was to look at the `ggplot2` cheatsheet -> 2nd page -> Bottom right corner -> "Zooming"

* `ylim(a, b)` sets the limit on the y-axis to be between `a` to `b` and "clips" (throws out) any points outside this interval
* `coord_cartesian(ylim=c(a, b))` zooms in on the the y-axis to be between `a` to `b` but does not "clip" (throw out) the points outside this interval

For example, consider the following regression line: 

```{r, fig.width = 8/1.5, height = 4.5/1.5}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

example <- tibble(
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  y = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 5)
)

ggplot(example, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Let's set the y-axis limit to be between 0 and 3. Using `ylim(0, 3)` clips out the point `(5, 5)` and thus the regression line is flat:

```{r, fig.width = 8/1.5, height = 4.5/1.5}
ggplot(example, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ylim(0, 3)
```

However, using `coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 3))` merely zooms in on this part of the y-axis without clipping the point `(5, 5)` and thus the regression line is the original one: 

```{r, fig.width = 8/1.5, height = 4.5/1.5}
ggplot(example, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 3))
```

# Lec 12: Fri 10/4 {#Lec12}

## Announcements

* Part of class-time on Monday to work on MP1
* Go over updated [Midterm I](midterms.html) instructions

## Today's topics/activities

### 1. Chalk talk

* Trend lines. Two types (among many):
    + Linear regression
    + LOESS smoother:  
    ![](static/images/loess.gif)
* Let's make a Shiny interactive visualization! If this is your first shiny app, you will need to install some packages: say "yes" to any prompts.
    1. Go to RStudio menu bar -> File -> New File... -> Shiny -> Give it title "LOESS smoother"
    1. Let's keep things simple and delete everything after line 38
    1. Save it as `loess.Rmd`
    1. Click "Run Document"
    1. See all possible input methods by looking at cheatsheet. Go to RStudio menu bar -> Help -> Cheatsheets -> Web Applications with Shiny -> Look at right-side of first page.


### 2. In-class exercise

First, copy this to your `classnotes.Rmd` and go over code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)

# 1. Recreate plot from PS02 but with no color:
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)

# 1.a) Add LOESS smoother layer with geom_smooth()
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# 1.b) Remove standard error bars
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

# 1.c) Change span of "smoothing" window by changing span = value. Try different values.
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, span = 0.25)

# 1.d) Force line to be straight. i.e. linear regression
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Second, in `loess.Rmd` you're change only the code within the code

```
renderPlot({ 
    
    
})
```

to make an interactive version of plot 1.c) above.

Say the following piecharts represent results of an election poll at time points: A = September, B = October, and C = November. At each time point we present the proportion of the poll respondents who say they will support one of 5 candidates: 1 through 5. 

![](static/images/piecharts.png){ width=600px }

Based on these 3 piecharts, answer the following questions:

1. At time point A, is candidate 5 doing better than candidate 4?
1. Did candidate 3 do better at time point B or time point C?
1. Who gained more support between time point A and time point B, candidate 2 or candidate 4?


Compare that to using barplots. Which do you prefer?

## Today's topics/activities

### 1. Chalk talk

* Recap of histograms
* Facets to split a visualization by the values of another variable
* Boxplots! Powerful, but tricky!


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
example <- tibble(
  values = c(1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 30)
)
```

Say we want to study the distribution of the following `r nrow(example)` values which are pre-sorted: 

> `r example %>% pull(values)`

They have the following *summary statistics*. A summary statistic is a single numerical value *summarizing* many values. Examples include the immediately obvious mean AKA average and median. Other less immediately obvious examples include:

* Quartiles (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) that cut up the data into 4 parts, each containing roughly one quarter = 25% of the data
* Minimum & maximum
* Interquartile-range (IQR): the distance between the 3rd and 1st quartiles

Min. | 1st Quartile | Median = 2nd Quartile  | 3rd Quartile  |  Max. | IQR
---- | ------- | ------  |  ------- | --- | ---
`r min(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.25, type = 2)` |  `r median(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.75, type=2)`  | `r max(example$values)` | 8 = 13.5 - 5.5


Let's compare the points and the corresponding boxplot side-by-side with the values on the $y$-axis matching:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plot1 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Points") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )

plot2 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )
plot1 + plot2
```


### 2. In-class exercise

* Go over ModernDive 2.6 - 2.7
* Start PS03

I don't mind what you do with your class time, but it is very important that you complete the reading before next lecture. Boxplots take practice.

    + Uncheck box next to "Show output inline for all R Markdown Documents"
1. **Create new R Markdown `.Rmd` file**:
    + Go to RStudio menu bar -> File -> New File -> R Markdown 
    + Set "Title" to "My first R Markdown report" and "Author" as your name.
1. **"Knit" a report**:
    + Click on the disk icon and save this file as `testing` somewhere on your computer. This will create a file called `testing.Rmd`
    + Click the arrow next to "Knit" -> "Knit to HTML".
    + An HTML webpage should pop up. However, it may be blocked by your browser. If so, in your browser's URL bar on the right, click on "Always allow pop-ups".

1. **Bonus**: Play around with different formatting tools in R Markdown to customize your report! Go to RStudio menu bar -> Help -> Markdown quick reference.


**Tips on R Markdown**:

1. Knit early, knit often! If you wait until only after you've added a ton of code to knit and something doesn't work, you'll have a hard time figuring out where the error is. If you make incremental changes and knit after every step, you'll better able to isolate where errors are.
1. If you get stuck, **go through these [6 R Markdown Fixes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/){target="_blank"} first**, then seek assistance. These 6 fixes resolve 85% of issues in my experience.

*About readings in this course*:

* You are responsible for completing a lecture's readings before the next lecture. Ex: you are responsible to read all of ModernDive Chapter 1 before Wednesday.
* I teach lectures assuming you have not done the readings beforehand. However, if it suits your learning style better, please do read beforehand.
* While you don't need to turn in your learning check answers, I *highly* recommend you still do them. The solutions are in Appendix D of the book.
* If you have your headphones, you may listen to music during in-class reading time.
