# Lec 37: Wed 12/11 {#Lec37}

## Announcements

* SDS Major Fatima Keita is interested in organizing a group for students of color within SDS. She has also put together a [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2YZ785Y){target="_blank"} to gather students of color's experiences within SDS courses and the program more generally. The idea is that these experiences would then be anonymously shared with the SDS faculty in hope that we can work to improve inclusivity within the program and curriculum.  
* Comment about ModernDive:
    + Always free, always available at [ModernDive.com](https://moderndive.com/)
    + Thank you for your role in making it happen!

## Today's Topics/Activities

<center>
![](static/images/SQL.jpg){ width=300px }
</center>
<br>

* **If you remember only one important fact from today's lecture, remember this**:
    + If you know the `dplyr` package for data wrangling, you can get started with the SQL relational database management language in a day.
    + **Why?** Because they are both based on the same theoretical underpinning: [Database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization){target="_blank"} (1970).  
    Thus you can [transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_learning){target="_blank"} your _previous_ learnings to learn these _new_ tools.
* **Similarly**:
    + If you know the `ggplot2` package for data visualization, you can get started with data visualization platforms like [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/){target="_blank"} and [plotly](https://plot.ly/){target="_blank"} in a day. 
    + **Why?** Because they are both based on the same theoretical underpinning: [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447){target="_blank"} (2005).  
    Thus you can [transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_learning){target="_blank"} your _previous_ learnings to learn these _new_ tools.

### 1. Chalk Talk

* What SQL is about.
* 3 ways to access SQL.
* Some key SQL language *syntax*: set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language.

### 2. In-class exercise

**Goal**: Perform 2-3 SQL queries to convince yourself that "if you know `dplyr`, you can get started with SQL in a day." You'll be using databases on the `scidb.smith.edu` database created by our very own Prof. Ben Baumer!

* Install and open [MySQLWorkbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/){target="_blank"}; this whole process takes about 10 minutes and necessitates creating an account with Oracle.
* Close the "Welcome to MySQL Workbench" message
* Click the plus sign next to "MySQL Connections" to add a connection to a SQL database.
* Setup a new connection" as shown in Slide 13/16 of this [slide deck](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/lectures/29-sql.html#16).
* Click the resulting "scidb" box and input the password shown on Slide 13. Click "Continue Anyway"
* Copy and paste the code below into the Query window
* Run the 10 individual code segments delineated by `/*SQL comments*/` one at a time by highlighting them and clicking the "lightning" button.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rudeboybert/35098400f4f36c36fc5d0e96cb40786d.js"></script>

If you want to learn more, check out SDS Prof. Ben Baumer's notes [here](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/schedule.html#lam_2:_database_querying){target="_blank"}.

# Lec 29: Fri 11/15 {#Lec29}

## Announcements

* Sit next to your MP3 partner
* Guest lecturer: Prof. Ben Baumer

### Mega Announcement

Recently, the Five Colleges (with Smith as the lead institution) received a three-year grant from the NSF (totaling $1.2 million) for workforce development in data science. Most of that money will go to students, who will work on real-world data science projects sponsored by local community-based organizations. The Jandon Center for Community Engagement will be integrated into the project to bind all parties together. 

We are looking for students to join the first cohort. Smith students can earn up to $2500 per semester, which is approximately 60% more than you would make in any other campus job. The minimum requirements for data science students are:

* Has taken at least one course in computer programming
* Has taken at least one course in statistics
* Has taken at least one additional course in data science, data analysis, etc.
* Is a sophomore or junior
* Ability to commit to 8-10 hours per week through the spring semester

Unfortunately, only US citizens or permanent residents are eligible for funding from the NSF. It is possible that international students could be funded through a different mechanism, but there are no such alternative funding sources in place at present. 

The application is [here](https://dsc-wav.github.io/www/students.html){target="_blank"}, please APPLY NOW!! Please contact Ben Baumer if you have more questions.

* Check out the Jill Ker Conway Innovation & Entrepreneurship Center's feature on [SDS student Rachel Laflamme](https://conway-connect.com/innovation-news/2019/10/31/datascienceatvaliantlabs){target="_blank"}. In particular the quotes from the final paragraph:

> Rachel indicated that being surrounded by "so many really intimidating Smithies" in classes, students who she believed were much smarter than she, caused her to question whether she should even pursue a career as a statistical and data scientist. Needless to say, those of us in attendance during her presentation - one delivered by a knowledgeable, talented and confident Smithie - were surprised by her revelation...
> 
> Asked about her most important take-away from the summer, Rachel thoughtfully replied:  
> **"I learned that you have to understand your value and that you have a right to be compensated for the value that you bring. It’s a bold thing to fight for what you know you’re worth."**

## Today's topics/activities

### 1. Chalk talk

* Recap of barplots: Exercise on pie charts vs barplots below
* Color theory
    1. `color` vs `fill` aesthetics in `ggplot2`
    1. Selecting an appropriate color palette from [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org/){target="_blank"}
    ![](static/images/colorbrewer.png){ width=600px }
    1. How does `ggplot2` pick default colors? Using a [color wheel](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21490210/how-to-plot-a-colour-wheel-by-using-ggplot){target="_blank"}
    1. Also define colors in terms of [hex codes](https://www.color-hex.com/color/f8766d){target="_blank"}


    
### 2. Exercise on pie charts vs barplots

Say the following piecharts represent results of an election poll at time points: A = September, B = October, and C = November. At each time point we present the proportion of the poll respondents who say they will support one of 5 candidates: 1 through 5. 

![](static/images/piecharts.png){ width=600px }

Based on these 3 piecharts, answer the following questions:

1. At time point A, is candidate 5 doing better than candidate 4?
1. Did candidate 3 do better at time point B or time point C?
1. Who gained more support between time point A and time point B, candidate 2 or candidate 4?

Compare that to using barplots. Which do you prefer?

![](static/images/barplots.png){ width=600px }


### 3. In-class exercise

* Go over ModernDive reading in schedule above.
* Changing default `color` and `fill` color aesthetics: 
    1. Copy and paste the code below into your `classnotes.Rmd` file
    1. Change both the color of the scatterplot points and the fill of the bars. You can do this by selecting a palette from [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org/){target="_blank"} or by setting them manually
    1. Run `colors()` in your console to get English names of all colors in R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(gapminder)

# 1. Recreate plot from PS02, but change default "color" palette of points:
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)
ggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

# 2.a) Recreate Figure 2.26 but change default "fill" color of bars by adding a 
# palette layer:
ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

# 2.b) Recreate Figure 2.26 but change default "fill" color of bars by manually 
# changing colors in a layer:
ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange", "forestgreen", "navyblue"))

# 2.c) Recreate Figure 2.26 but change default "fill" color of bars by manually 
# changing colors in a layer using hex codes from:

# Lec 07: Mon 9/20 {#Lec07}

## Announcements

* Office of Disability Services is looking to hire a note taker for the class. If interested, see note in Slack `#general`. 
* Problem sets:
    + PS02 due today at 5pm
    + PS03 to be posted by 6pm today



## Today's topics/activities

### 1. Chalk talk

* Recap of histograms
* Facets to split a visualization by the values of another variable
* Default ordering of functions such as `ggplot()` where `data = ` is assumed first and `mapping = ` is assumed second
* Boxplots! Powerful, but tricky!


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
example <- tibble(
  values = c(1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 30)
)
```

Say we want to study the distribution of the following `r nrow(example)` values which are pre-sorted: 

> `r example %>% pull(values)`

They have the following *summary statistics*. A summary statistic is a single numerical value *summarizing* many values. Examples include the immediately obvious mean AKA average and median. Other less immediately obvious examples include:

* Quartiles (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) that cut up the data into 4 parts, each containing roughly one quarter = 25% of the data
* Minimum & maximum
* Interquartile-range (IQR): the distance between the 3rd and 1st quartiles

Min. | 1st Quartile | Median = 2nd Quartile  | 3rd Quartile  |  Max. | IQR
---- | ------- | ------  |  ------- | --- | ---
`r min(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.25, type = 2)` |  `r median(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.75, type=2)`  | `r max(example$values)` | 8 = 13.5 - 5.5


Let's compare the points and the corresponding boxplot side-by-side with the values on the $y$-axis matching:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plot1 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Points") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )

plot2 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )
plot1 + plot2
```

# Lec 05: Wed 9/15 {#Lec05}

## Announcements

* PS02 was posted after Monday's lecture.

## Today's topics/activities

### 1. Chalk talk

* Overplotting and two approaches for addressing it
* Linegraphs

### 2. In-class exercise

* Explore the different formatting tools in R Markdown: go to RStudio top menu bar -> Help -> Markdown quick reference.
* Sec01 in Stoddard: There was an typo in Step 8 in last lecture's in-class exercise. If you weren't able to Knit directly to PDF, please re-attempt Steps 8-9. Knitting directly to PDF, instead of Knitting to Word and then saving to PDF, is the preferred submission format for all problem sets. It will be less hassle for you and provide consistency for the graders.

### 2. In-class exercise

**In-class battle-testing and practicing for PS02:**

1. At a couple of steps in this process, you will be asked to install packages. Say yes to all of them.
1. If at any point your code won't knit, go through these [6 R Markdown Fixes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/){target="_blank"} first, then seek assistance. **These 6 fixes will resolve 85% of issues.**
1. **Create new R Markdown `.Rmd` file**:
    + Go to RStudio menu bar -> File -> New File -> R Markdown 
    + Set "Title" to "My first R Markdown report" and "Author" as your name.
    + Save this file as `testing` somewhere on your computer. This will create a file called `testing.Rmd`
1. **Method 1: "Knit" a report to HTML**:
    + Click the arrow next to "Knit" -> "Knit to HTML".
    + An HTML webpage should pop up. However, it may be blocked by your browser. If so, in your browser's URL bar, click on "Always allow pop-ups".
1. **Method 1: Publish HTML report on web**:
    + Click on blue "Publish" button on top right of the resulting **pop-up html**.
    + Select RPubs.
    + If you haven't previously, create an account on Rpubs.com. If you have previously, login.
    + Set "Title" to "My first R Markdown report" and "Slug" to "testing"
    + You should end up with a webpage that looks like this [one](http://rpubs.com/rudeboybert/testing){target="_blank"}. This is live on the web!
1. **Method 1: Update HTML report on web**:
    + Make some trivial change to your `testing.Rmd` file.
    + "Re-knit" your report and make sure your trivial change is reflected.
    + The blue "Publish" button should now read "Republish"
    + Click "Update existing"
    + Your updates are now live on the web!
1. **Method 2: "Knit" a report to Word**
    + Click the arrow next to "Knit" -> "Knit to Word".
    + Save the resulting Word document as a pdf file.
1. **Only if you are a macOS user**:
    + Next to "Console" go to "Terminal"
    + Run this line of code:   
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin
    ```
    + Enter your password. Note: Terminal has weird behavior whereby as you enter your password, the cursor will not move. Don't worry your password is registering. 
1. **Method 3: "Knit" a report to PDF**
    + Run the following code in your console just once:  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    install.packages('tinytex')
    tinytex::install_tinytex()
    ```
    + Click the arrow next to "Knit" -> "Knit to PDF".



<!--
1. **Fiddle with RStudio settings**:
    + Go to RStudio menu bar -> Tools -> Global Options... -> R Markdown
    + Uncheck box next to "Show output inline for all R Markdown Documents"
-->
