* Wednesday is final lecture I'll be present; on Friday the Spinelli data assistants will hold in-class office hours.
* Note on coding style
    + Check out the [`tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}.
    + Why is it important to write clean code, that is well documented, and actually works? To be mindful of the work you create for your [most important collaborator](https://rmhogervorst.nl/cleancode/blog/2016/05/26/content/post/2016-05-26-your-most-valuable-collaborator-future-you/){target="_blank"}.


## Today's Topics/Activities

    + `patchwork`: Combine two ggplots together
    + `janitor`: Clean-up messy variable names
* Work on Final Project

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# 1. Combine two ggplots together using patchwork package:
library(patchwork)

plot_1 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))
plot_2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))

# Side-by-side:
plot_1 + plot_2

# On top of each other:
plot_1 / plot_2


# 2. Say we have a data frame with really messy names:
data_frame_ugly <- tibble(
  `asdf ?!? qwerty%` = c(1, 2),
  variable.name...NAMES = c(2,1)
)
data_frame_ugly

# You can clean them very easily using the clean_names() function from the 
# janitor package
library(janitor)
data_frame_clean <- data_frame_ugly %>% 
  clean_names()
data_frame_clean
```

## Today's Topics/Activities

### 1. Chalk Talk

* `dplyr` and SQL are very similar. Both based on the same idea of [database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization){target="_blank"} (1970).
* Moral of the story: If you know the `dplyr` package for data wrangling, you can learn SQL very quickly.

### 2. In-class exercise

Perform 2-3 SQL queries to convince yourself that if you know `dplyr`, you can learn SQL very quickly. This exercise is based on Prof. Baumer's [lecture notes](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/lectures/29-sql.html#1){target="_blank"}.

1. Setup
    1. Install and open [MySQLWorkbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/){target="_blank"}; this whole process takes about 10 minutes and necessitates creating an account with Oracle.
    1. Close the "Welcome to MySQL Workbench" message
    1. Click the plus sign next to "MySQL Connections" to add a connection to a SQL database.
    1. Setup a new connection" as shown in `#general` in Slack
    1. Click the resulting "Playing with SQL" connection and input the password in `#general` in Slack
1. Running SQL code
    1. Copy and paste the code below into the Query window
    1. For each of the 10 code segments: highlight it and then run it by clicking the "lightning" icon.

## Today's topics/activities

### 1. Chalk talk

* Recap of barplots: Exercise on pie charts vs barplots below
* Color theory
    1. `color` vs `fill` aesthetics in `ggplot2`
    1. Selecting an appropriate color palette from [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org/){target="_blank"}
    ![](static/images/colorbrewer.png){ width=600px }
    1. How does `ggplot2` pick default colors? Using a [color wheel](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21490210/how-to-plot-a-colour-wheel-by-using-ggplot){target="_blank"}
    1. Also define colors in terms of [hex codes](https://www.color-hex.com/color/f8766d){target="_blank"}


    
### 2. Exercise on pie charts vs barplots

Say the following piecharts represent results of an election poll at time points: A = September, B = October, and C = November. At each time point we present the proportion of the poll respondents who say they will support one of 5 candidates: 1 through 5. 

![](static/images/piecharts.png){ width=600px }

Based on these 3 piecharts, answer the following questions:

1. At time point A, is candidate 5 doing better than candidate 4?
1. Did candidate 3 do better at time point B or time point C?
1. Who gained more support between time point A and time point B, candidate 2 or candidate 4?

Compare that to using barplots. Which do you prefer?

![](static/images/barplots.png){ width=600px }


### 3. In-class exercise

* Go over ModernDive reading in schedule above.
* Changing default `color` and `fill` color aesthetics: 
    1. Copy and paste the code below into your `classnotes.Rmd` file
    1. Change both the color of the scatterplot points and the fill of the bars. You can do this by selecting a palette from [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org/){target="_blank"} or by setting them manually
    1. Run `colors()` in your console to get English names of all colors in R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(gapminder)

# 1. Recreate plot from PS02, but change default "color" palette of points:
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)
ggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

# 2.a) Recreate Figure 2.26 but change default "fill" color of bars by adding a 
# palette layer:
ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

# 2.b) Recreate Figure 2.26 but change default "fill" color of bars by manually 
# changing colors in a layer:
ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange", "forestgreen", "navyblue"))

# 2.c) Recreate Figure 2.26 but change default "fill" color of bars by manually 
# changing colors in a layer using hex codes from: 
# https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/114219
ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +

# Lec 07: Mon 9/20 {#Lec07}

## Announcements

* Office of Disability Services is looking to hire a note taker for the class. If interested, see note in Slack `#general`. 
* Problem sets:
    + PS02 due today at 5pm
    + PS03 to be posted by 6pm today



## Today's topics/activities

### 1. Chalk talk

* Recap of histograms
* Facets to split a visualization by the values of another variable
* Default ordering of functions such as `ggplot()` where `data = ` is assumed first and `mapping = ` is assumed second
* Boxplots! Powerful, but tricky!


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
example <- tibble(
  values = c(1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 30)
)
```

Say we want to study the distribution of the following `r nrow(example)` values which are pre-sorted: 

> `r example %>% pull(values)`

They have the following *summary statistics*. A summary statistic is a single numerical value *summarizing* many values. Examples include the immediately obvious mean AKA average and median. Other less immediately obvious examples include:

* Quartiles (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) that cut up the data into 4 parts, each containing roughly one quarter = 25% of the data
* Minimum & maximum
* Interquartile-range (IQR): the distance between the 3rd and 1st quartiles

Min. | 1st Quartile | Median = 2nd Quartile  | 3rd Quartile  |  Max. | IQR
---- | ------- | ------  |  ------- | --- | ---
`r min(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.25, type = 2)` |  `r median(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.75, type=2)`  | `r max(example$values)` | 8 = 13.5 - 5.5


Let's compare the points and the corresponding boxplot side-by-side with the values on the $y$-axis matching:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plot1 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Points") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )

plot2 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )
plot1 + plot2
```

------------- | -------------
![](static/images/rmd_input.png){ width=800px } | ![](static/images/rmd_output.png){ width=800px }


### 2. In-class exercise

**In-class battle-testing and practicing for PS02:**

1. At a couple of steps in this process, you will be asked to install packages. Say yes to all of them.
1. If at any point your code won't knit, go through these [6 R Markdown Fixes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/){target="_blank"} first, then seek assistance. **These 6 fixes will resolve 85% of issues.**
1. **Create new R Markdown `.Rmd` file**:
    + Go to RStudio menu bar -> File -> New File -> R Markdown 
    + Set "Title" to "My first R Markdown report" and "Author" as your name.
    + Save this file as `testing` somewhere on your computer. This will create a file called `testing.Rmd`
1. **Method 1: "Knit" a report to HTML**:
    + Click the arrow next to "Knit" -> "Knit to HTML".
    + An HTML webpage should pop up. However, it may be blocked by your browser. If so, in your browser's URL bar, click on "Always allow pop-ups".
1. **Method 1: Publish HTML report on web**:
    + Click on blue "Publish" button on top right of the resulting **pop-up html**.
    + Select RPubs.
    + If you haven't previously, create an account on Rpubs.com. If you have previously, login.
    + Set "Title" to "My first R Markdown report" and "Slug" to "testing"
    + You should end up with a webpage that looks like this [one](http://rpubs.com/rudeboybert/testing){target="_blank"}. This is live on the web!
1. **Method 1: Update HTML report on web**:
    + Make some trivial change to your `testing.Rmd` file.
    + "Re-knit" your report and make sure your trivial change is reflected.
    + The blue "Publish" button should now read "Republish"
    + Click "Update existing"
    + Your updates are now live on the web!
1. **Method 2: "Knit" a report to Word**
    + Click the arrow next to "Knit" -> "Knit to Word".
    + Save the resulting Word document as a pdf file.
1. **Only if you are a macOS user**:
    + Next to "Console" go to "Terminal"
    + Run this line of code:   
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin
    ```
    + Enter your password. Note: Terminal has weird behavior whereby as you enter your password, the cursor will not move. Don't worry your password is registering. 
1. **Method 3: "Knit" a report to PDF**
    + Run the following code in your console just once:  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    install.packages('tinytex')
    tinytex::install_tinytex()
    ```
    + Click the arrow next to "Knit" -> "Knit to PDF".



<!--
1. **Fiddle with RStudio settings**:
    + Go to RStudio menu bar -> Tools -> Global Options... -> R Markdown
    + Uncheck box next to "Show output inline for all R Markdown Documents"
-->

*About readings in this course*:

* You are responsible for completing a lecture's readings before the next lecture. Ex: you are responsible to read all of ModernDive Chapter 1 before Wednesday.
* I teach lectures assuming you have not done the readings beforehand. However, if it suits your learning style better, please do read beforehand.
* While you don't need to turn in your learning check answers, I *highly* recommend you still do them. The solutions are in Appendix D of the book.
* If you have your headphones, you may listen to music during in-class reading time.
