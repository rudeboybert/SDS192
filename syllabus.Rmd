## Instructor work-life balance {#work-life-balance}

* I will respond to Slack messages sent during the week within 24h. I will respond to Slack messages sent during the weekend at my own discretion.
* If possible, please only Slack me with briefer and administrative questions; I prefer having more substantive conversations in person as it takes me less energy to understand where you are at.
* I will do my best to return all grading as promptly as possible.
* I will rarely be on campus on Thursdays as this is my self-care day.

# How can I succeed in this class?

Ask yourself:

* **When I have questions or don't understand something:**
    + *"Am I asking questions in class?"*
    + *"Am I asking questions on Slack in the `#questions` channel?"* Even better: *"Am I answering my peers' questions on Slack?"*
    + *"Having I been going to the Spinelli tutoring center for help on R and the tidyverse?"*
    + *"Have I been coming to office hours?"*
* **Lectures, labs, and readings:**
    + *"Am I staying on top Slack notifications sent between lectures?"* If you need help developing a notification strategy that best suits your lifestyle, please speak to me. 
    + *"Am I attending lectures consistently?"*
    + *"Am I actually running the code and studying the outputs in R during in-class exercises, or am I just going through the motions?"*
    + *"During in-class exercises, am I taking full advantage that I'm in the same place at the same time with the instructor, the lab assistants, and most importantly your peers, or am I browsing the web/texting the whole time?"*
    + *"Have I been doing the associated readings for each lecture?"*

# Evaluation

<!--
## Engagement 10% {#engagement}

It is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes "an engaged student," so
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: *you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in*. That being said, here are multiple
pathways for you to stay engaged in this class:

* Asking and answering questions in class.
* Coming to office hours.
* Posting questions on Slack. Even better, responding to questions on Slack.
* Your peer evaluations for your mini-projects.


## Midterms 35%

* Two midterms during the semester
* Lower score weighted 15% and higher score weighted 20%.


## Five mini-projects 50%

* Mini-project 1: 5% - Groups of 2 selected by instructor.
* Mini-project 2: 7.5% - Groups of 2 selected by yourselves, must be a new partner.
* Mini-project 3: 10% - Groups of 2 selected by instructor, you'll be assigned a new partner.
* Mini-project 4: 12.5% - Groups of 2 selected by yourselves, must be a new partner.
* Mini-project 5: 15% - Groups of 2-3 freely chosen by yourselves.


## Policies

1. **Collaboration**: While I encourage you to work with your peers for problem
sets and labs, you must submit your own answers and not simple rewordings of
another's work. Furthermore, all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged
in your submissions.
1. **Honor Code**: All your work must follow the [Smith College Academic Honor
Code Statement](https://www.smith.edu/sao/handbook/socialconduct/honorcode.php){target="_blank"};
in particular all external sources must be cited in your submissions.
1. **Mini-projects and DataCamp**:
    + No extensions will be granted without a dean's note.
1. **Midterms/quizzes**:
    + No make-up quizzes or midterms will be allowed without a dean's note. 
    + Timestamps for all midterms will be strictly enforced.
1. **Grading**: I reserve the right to not discuss any grading issues in class and instead direct you to office hours.
