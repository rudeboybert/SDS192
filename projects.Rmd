Everything in this course builds up to the final group project, where there is
only one learning goal: *Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as
faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.* To get practice however there will be 3 mini-projects first.

# Mini-Project 1 {#MP1}

*Partially assigned on Friday 9/27, completely assigned on Monday 9/30, due Friday 10/11 at 5pm.*


**Note: This is a work in progress minimally viable product**: I will have fuller details on Monday 9/30, including submission format and grading rubric.

Basic outline:

1. Identify a question about how you use your time *that you feel comfortable sharing with your partner and me*.
1. Start the data collection process: start logging time in Google Calendar, macOS Calendar, and Outlook.
1. Import the calendar data into R. Do this early, do this often!
1. Exchange data! You will pass your question and data to your partner, and they will do an analysis by creating two data visualizations.
1. Write a joint reflection piece on this experience, keeping the podcast in mind. In particular
    + As someone who provides data: What expectations do you have when you give your data?
    + As someone who analyzes other's data: What legal and ethical responsibilites do you have?
