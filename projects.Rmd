Everything in this course builds up to the final group project, where there is
only one learning goal: *Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as
faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.* To get practice however there will be 3 mini-projects first.

# Mini-Project 1 {#MP1}

<!--
Things to remember for next time

- Has to involve intervals of time: a start time and end time. For example, not "I went to sleep at." but "I slept during these times."
- Add grading rubric
- Output the data frame in a kable table
- How long does the analysis need to be? No firm rule, but think: if there are two equally insightful reports, one is 20 pages and the other is 2 pages. which will you read? Or think when you visit a webpage. How long does it take you to decide if you're going to read it.
- Graphs can't be redundant: Think in terms of ink/information ratio. 5 sentences or less for analysis of each graph.
- When calendar entries are set to "repeat" only the first entry shows up
- Enter in at least two types of activities in calendar. this becomes the summary categorical variable
with two levels.
- In reflection piece: tie in with podcast. difficulty of collecting data. 
- Issue with time intervals being imported in seconds, minutes, hours, 
-->

*Partially assigned on Friday 9/27, completely assigned on Monday 9/30, due Friday 10/11 at 5pm.*

Basic outline:

1. Identify a question about how you use your time *that you feel comfortable sharing with your partner and me*.
1. Start the data collection process: start logging time in Google Calendar, macOS Calendar, and Outlook.
1. Import the calendar data into R. Do this early, do this often!
1. Exchange data! You will pass your question and data to your partner, and they will do an analysis by creating two data visualizations.
1. Write a joint reflection piece on this experience, keeping the podcast in mind. In particular
    + As someone who provides data: What expectations do you have when you give your data?
    + As someone who analyzes other's data: What legal and ethical responsibilites do you have?
    + The joint reflection piece should be of no more than 500 words. I suggest you write it in Google Docs and then export to PDF.
    
The following screencast illustrates Steps 2 and 3 above:

## Step 0: Identify groups

* Look in Slack in `#mp1` channel to see your group, your group number, and who your group leader is.

## Step 1: Download starter code

* Download <a href="static/MP1.zip" download>`MP1.zip`</a> and double-click it to "unzip" it
* Rename the `MP1_lastname_firstname.Rmd` file to have your last and first name
* Knit the `.Rmd` file once and read it over
* Create two data visualizations and provide an analysis to answer your partner's question

## Step 2: Submit

1. Everyone: Submit the following three files on Moodle:
    a) The `.ics` calendar file with your partner's calendar data. **Added 9/30:** You should both be logging calendar data until Wed 10/9.
    a) The `.Rmd` R Markdown file analyzing your partner's calendar data.
    a) The `.html` output file
1. Everyone: Fill out the peer evaluation [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdINjxeoi0bCsicx8SfcLkjV2V0j4XgMB959oQ5q2GVIhthjg/viewform){target="_blank"}
1. Group leader only: PDF of 500 word joint reflection piece.


## Tip: Minimally viable product

When building a product, IMO:

**Don't**: Try to do everything completely and perfectly from the beginning. This leads to perfectionist thinking, which leads to procrastination and "analysis paralysis".

**Do**: Start by finishing a [minimially viable product](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/02/27/what-is-a-minimum-viable-product-and-why-do-companies-need-them/#178bd8a2382c){target="_blank"} FAST:

Only you're done your MVP, iterate and improve by adding complexity.

**In other words**:

*Assigned on Friday 10/18, due Friday 11/1 at 5pm.*

## Data

You will work with a partner to analyze Federal Election Commission data based on the 2011--2012 federal election cycle, as provided by the [Federal Election Commission](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml#archive_link). Be sure to read the [supporting documentation for these data](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml#archive_link){target="_blank"}.

The theme of your analysis will be **follow the money** as quoted by Lester Freamon from the HBO show The Wire. Only for your project the context will not be the drug war in Baltimore MD, but rather political contributions in elections.

## Examples

Here are two randomly chosen examples to give a qualitative sense of the outcome. Note they both can be improved on.

* [Example 1](static/projects/MP2/MP2_example_1.html){target="_blank"}
* [Example 2](static/projects/MP2/MP2_example_2.html){target="_blank"}


## Doing the project

* **Step 0**: Look in Slack in `#mp2` channel to see your group, your group number, and who your group leader is.
* **Step 1**: Setup the MP2 RStudio project
    1. Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pU9BpVUTBw1AFU8VUknnD6BdwTSPwfCH" download>`MP2.zip`</a>.
    1. Move `MP2.zip` to wherever you keep your 192 files.
        + macOS users: Double-click `MP2.zip` to extract the `MP2` folder.
        + Windows users: Extract the contents of `MP2.zip` to a folder.
    1. Double click the `MP2.Rproj` file to open RStudio in "Project mode":  
    ![](static/images/MP2.png){ width=100px }
    1. Verify that you are in RStudio Project mode by looking at the top right corner of RStudio. You should see this:  
    ![](static/images/MP2_2.png){ width=100px }
    1. Knit `MP2.Rmd` and go over the example R Markdown presentation tricks.
    1. `View()` all four data frames that are loaded into R: `candidates`, `committees`, `contributions`, `house_elections`.
* **Tips**:
    1. Always work in RStudio Project mode. This will help R locate your `.csv` files easily.
    1. Knit early and knit often. For example:
        + If you add 5 lines of code and the R Markdown doesn't knit, you can easily locate the error.
        + If you add 500 lines of code and the R Markdown doesn't knit, you'll have a harder time locating the error.
    1. If you're confused about the meaning of variables in the four datasets, be sure to read the [supporting documentation for these data](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml#archive_link){target="_blank"}.
    1. Ask questions in the `#mp2` slack channel.

## Grading rubric

**Note**: This rubric is likely not perfect. Please don't be shy to ask for

1. **Baseline:** Projects that do not satisfy all "baseline" criteria can expect to get a grade of less than 8/10.
    + The `MP2.Rmd` R Markdown file must "knit" correctly when *someone else* knits it. This is known as producing reproducible research.
    + All visualizations have appropriately labeled axes, legends, titles, etc. Such information gives the data's context.
    + All visualizations are mindful of the [ink/information ratio](https://medium.com/@sudharsanasai/declutter-your-chart-with-data-ink-ratio-6f6908727842){target="_blank"}.
    + From the report reader's perspective, there should be no "superfluous" and non-informative output (examples include instructions text). You must be empathetic to your reader, or your reader will just throw your report in the trash. 
    + You submit your peer evaluation.
1. **Minimally viable product:** Grade: 8/10.
    + Satisfy all "baseline" criteria.
    + Create one data visualization that "follows the money" i.e. involves campaign contributions and include a written analysis.
1. **Due diligence:** Grade: 9/10.
    + Satisfy all "baseline" and "minimally viable product" criteria.
    + The data visualization from the "minimally viable product" should be based on at least two joined data frames. 
1. **Point of diminishing returns:** Grade: 9.5/10.
    + Create a second data visualization that builds on the first data visualization, but is also non-redundant to the first. Include a written analysis.
1. [**Polishing the cannonball**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Polishing%20the%20Cannonball){target="_blank"}: Grade: 10/10
    + Satisfy all "baseline", "minimally viable product", "due diligence", and "point of diminishing returns" criteria.
    + Written text does an exceptional job of not only addressing "What is happening?" questions, but also "Why is this happening?" questions (this criteria is subjective).


## To submit

1. Each group will make only one submission: the group leader will submit a `.zip` file of all the contents of the `MP2` folder on Moodle.
1. **Individually**: Fill out the peer evaluation [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPAojeiucovzcoKb-6-zrplAvhKGGqt1YXz5dv1JYlQqzbXg/viewform){target="_blank"}

# Mini-Project 3 {#MP3}

<!--
Things to remember for next time

- 
-->

*Assigned on Monday 11/11, due Friday 11/22 at 5pm.*











<!--
## Administrative Notes

The best projects will:

* Discuss an interesting and well-motivated topic
* Involve some non-trivial data wrangling (e.g. not just a bunch of `mutate()`s)
* Provide a well thought-out, informative analysis
* Convey some sort of insight
* Be well-written



## Grading Rubric

There are 15 possible points for this mini-project.

**Baseline**

* +1 for an `.Rmd` that compiles without errors and is replicable and reproducible by someone else who has the same `MP2.zip` starting point of files.
* +2 for both group members completing the Individual Google Form
* **Updated Mon 10/29 - Moved to Advanced**: ~~+1 for using [code folding](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#code-folding) to keep your code hidden, but still make it available.~~ 
* +1 for using at least two of the five basic verbs (i.e., `select()`, `mutate()`, etc.)
* +1 for annotating your data wrangling pipeline (this can be in a few sentences in text surrounding the R code chunks, or some informative comments inside the R code chunks)
* +1 unnecessary messages from R are hidden from being displayed in the HTML

**Average**

* +1 for having at least 400 words and no more than 600 words. **Updated Mon 10/29 - Removed**: ~~(use [the word count add-in](https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin))~~. Use Google Docs/Microsoft Word to ensure your word count is correct.
* +1 for explaining in a single coherent sentence what we can learn from these data
* +1 for using at least one join (e.g. `left_join()`, `inner_join()`, etc.)
* +1 for providing context or background useful in interpreting the graphic

**Advanced**

* **Updated Mon 10/29 - Removed**: ~~+1 for writing a function to generalize your analysis rather than re-writing the same code multiple times~~
* **Updated Mon 10/29 - Moved here**: +1 for using [code folding](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#code-folding) to keep your code hidden, but still make it available. You need to figure out how to do this on your own! Example of code folding in practice [here](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/lab-rmarkdown.html#){target="_blank"}; note all "Code" buttons along right-hand edge of page.
* +0–4 XXX: awarded at the grader's discretion for submissions that are exceptionally compelling. What does "wow" factor mean? Ask yourself:
    + What is a checklist of criteria for a "great" calculus assignment?
    + What is a checklist of criteria for a "great" essay?
    + Guess what this mini-project is more like? A calculus assignment or an essay?
