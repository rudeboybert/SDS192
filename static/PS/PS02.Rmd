# Learning goals

* Getting used to "knitting" R Markdown documents 
* Baby's first data visualization: Recreating Figure 2.1 in moderndive.

# Honor code

For this problem set I worked with: 

# Setup

Load necessary packages:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
```

The `gapminder` package includes a data frame called `gapminder`, containing information about different countries from 1952 to 2007. Run `View(gapminder)` in your console to explore this data.

We're only going to only focus on data for 2007 and save this in a new data frame `gapminder_2007`. We use data wrangling using code from the `dplyr` package. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense for now, we'll cover data wrangling in Chapter 3 of ModernDive. For now, run the following code:

```{r}
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)
```

Run `View(gapminder_2007)` in your console to explore this data. An alternative method for exploring a data frame is by using the `glipmse()` function:

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder_2007)
```

This data is in fact the same data as in Table 2.1 of ModernDive.

# Question 1

Write the `ggplot2` that recreates Figure 2.1 of ModernDive. Do not worry about labeling the axes and legends for now. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Write your code below:

```


# Question 2

What is the country that had highest GDP per capita in 2007? Hint: Use the sorting functions in RStudio's Viewer.
