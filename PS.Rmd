* **R component**. A `.zip` file of your `PS06` RStudio Project folder. Due on Friday 11/15 at 10:45am on Moodle.
* **Quiz**. In-class on Monday 11/18. To do: Read the following Buzzfeed.com [article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup){target="_blank"} on DataCamp (an online platform for learning data science). We'll be having a brief in-class ethics discussion based on this article: What do we do when "bad" people make "good" technology?
    + **Added Sun 11/17**: For context, DataCamp is an online and interactive platform for learning data science, featuring [courses in R, python, SQL, and git](https://www.datacamp.com/search){target="_blank"}. 



## 1. R Markdown component {#PS06_R}

Learning goals:

* Get experience with maps by reproducing the two plots shown in this [example](http://rpubs.com/rudeboybert/PS06){target="_blank"}.
* Understand absolute vs relative file paths
* Start creating work that's reproducible

To do:

* Download the following template ~~`.Rmd` file~~ RStudio Project Folder: <a href="static/PS/PS06.zip" download>`PS06.zip`</a>.
* **Be sure to be in RStudio Project mode**
* Knit it once and read over the instructions.
* Complete the problem set.
* Submit a `.zip` file of all the contents of your `PS06` RStudio Project folder on [Moodle](https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=35357){target="_blank"}. 

**Hints**:

1. If your R Markdown file won't "knit", go through these [6 R Markdown Fixes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/){target="_blank"} first, then seek assistance. In my experience, these 6 fixes resolve 85% of issues.


## 2. Solutions & (imperfect) rubric {#PS06_solutions}

**Solution**:

Copy this <a href="static/PS/PS06_solutions.Rmd" download>`PS06_solutions.Rmd`</a> R Markdown solutions file and put it in your `PS06` RStudio Project folder.

**Hints**:

1. The resulting graph should be similar to the one [here](static/PS/PS02_hint.html){target="_blank"}.
1. For this problem set, I suggest you not try to write code from scratch, but rather take the copy/paste/tweak approach: find code that does something similar to what you want, copy it, paste it, and change it just enough so that it does what you want. As you get more comfortable, I suggest slowly trying to write code from scratch. 
1. Here is the screencast demo I recorded in class on the problem set workflow:
