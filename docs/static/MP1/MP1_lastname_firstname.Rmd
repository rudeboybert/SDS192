## Importing the calendar

You shouldn't need to modify the following data wrangling code:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Replace "192.ics" with the name of your calendar file:
calendar_data <- "~/Documents/2. Data Science/SDS192/static/MP1/192.ics" %>% 
  # Use ical package to import into R and then convert to "tibble" data frame format:
  ical_parse_df() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  # Use lubridate packge to wrangle dates and times. We'll do this later this semester:
  mutate(
    start_datetime = with_tz(start, tzone = "America/New_York"),
    end_datetime = with_tz(end, tzone = "America/New_York"),
    minutes = end_datetime - start_datetime,
    date = floor_date(start_datetime, unit = "day")
  ) %>%
  # Make calendar entry summary all lowercase:
  mutate(summary = tolower(summary)) %>% 
  # Do data wrangling to compute number of minutes and hours:
  group_by(date, summary) %>%
  summarize(minutes = sum(minutes) %>% as.numeric()) %>%
  mutate(hours = minutes/60)
```

Make sure you data looks good by looking at raw values

```{r}
glimpse(calendar_data)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Note by setting eval=FALSE, R Markdown will not "evaluate" this code chunk and 
# ignore it.
View(calendar_data)
```
