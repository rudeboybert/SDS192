# Learning goals

* Get experience with maps by reproducing the two plots shown in this [example](http://rpubs.com/rudeboybert/PS06){target="_blank"} (labels included).
* Understand absolute vs relative file paths
* Start creating work that's reproducible


# Honor code

For this problem set I worked with: 

# Setup

Load necessary packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
```


# Question 1: Show interactive map of all Clinton campaign stops

Use the `pres_2016_trail` data frame from the `fivethiryeight` package to plot an interactive
`leaflet` map of all of Hilary Clinton's 2016 campaign stops. **Hint**: There are two ways of doing this:

1. By plotting the data from a data frame and mapping the appropriate latitude and longitude variables (see [`leaflet` markers](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/markers.html) page for hints)
1. By plotting the data from an `sf` object (the mapping of latitude and longitude is done automatically)


```{r}
# Method 1 - Plotting data saved in a data frame:
clinton_stops_df <- pres_2016_trail %>% 
  filter(candidate == "Clinton")

leaflet(data = clinton_stops_df) %>%
  addTiles() %>% 
  # We need to map the lng, lat variables in clinton_stops_df
  addMarkers(lng = ~lng, lat = ~lat)

# Method 2 - Plotting data saved in an sf package object:
clinton_stops_sf <- pres_2016_trail %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lng", "lat"), crs = 4326) %>%
  filter(candidate == "Clinton")

leaflet(data = clinton_stops_sf) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  # No mapping of lng, lat variables need since it is done automatically
  addMarkers()
```




# Question 2: Show static map of Washington state shapefile

Plot a static map of the 39 counties in Western Washington using the shapefiles in the `WA_counties` folder. **Hint**: See the example of reading in shapefiles in the `MP3` RStudio Project folder.

```{r}
WA_counties <- "WA_counties/" %>%
  read_sf()
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = WA_counties) +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", title = "Washington State Counties")
```
