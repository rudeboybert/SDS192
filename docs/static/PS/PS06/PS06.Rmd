```{r, include=FALSE}

# Learning goals

* Working in RStudio Project mode
* Understand absolute vs relative file paths
* Practice making static maps


# Setup

Load necessary packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(maps)
```



# Question 1:  Honor code

For this problem set I worked with: 



# Question 2: Map of Washington State

Using the code from Lec26, create a map of Washington state with the cities of Seattle, Olympia, and Spokane marked with a dot.

```{r}

```





# Question 3: Map of Counties in Washington State

Create another map of Washington state with the same three cities marked, but this time showing all 39 counties using the `WA_counties` shapefile data. Use a **relative** filepath and not an **absolute** filepath to load this shapefile.

```{r}

```
