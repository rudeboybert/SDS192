```{r, include=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code block/chunk

```

# Learning goals

* Learn to "knit" R Markdown documents and create a PDF
* Recreate Figure 2.1 in ModernDive.
* Get familiar with the [6 R Markdown Fixes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/)

# Honor code

For this problem set I worked with: 


# Getting started

* At the top of this document replace `"WRITE YOUR NAME HERE"` with your name, including the quotation marks. Ex: `"Albert Y. Kim"`
* In the Honor code section above, indicate who (if anyone) you worked with. 


# Setup

Load necessary packages:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
```

The `gapminder` package includes a data frame called `gapminder`, containing information about different countries from 1952 to 2007. Run `View(gapminder)` in your console to explore this data.

We're only going to only focus on data for 2007 and save this in a new data frame `gapminder_2007`. We use data wrangling using code from the `dplyr` package. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense for now, we'll cover data wrangling in Chapter 3 of ModernDive. For now, run the following code:

```{r}
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)
```

Run `View(gapminder_2007)` in your console to explore this data. An alternative method for exploring a data frame is by using the `glipmse()` function:

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder_2007)
```

This data is in fact the same data as in Table 2.1 of ModernDive.

# Question 1

Write the `ggplot2` that recreates Figure 2.1 of ModernDive. Do not worry about labeling the axes and legends for now. 

```{r}
# Write your code below:
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  # Note: this was not required for this problem set:
  labs(x = "GDP per capita (in USD)", 
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       size = "Population", 
       color = "Continent", 
       title = "Gapminder data",
       subtitle = "2007 values")
```


# Question 2

Q: What country had the highest GDP per capita in 2007? Use the sorting arrows next to variable names in RStudio's `View()` function.

A: Norway
